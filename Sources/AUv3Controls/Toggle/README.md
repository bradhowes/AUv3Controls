# Toggle Control

A Composable Architcture feature that monitors and updates a boolean AUParameter, one that can be either 0 (false) or
1.0 (true).

- [CheckedToggleStyle](CheckedToggleStyle.swift) -- configuration for the toggle control.
- [ToggleFeature](ToggleFeature.swift) -- the main feature for a boolean control. It relies on underlying SwiftUI
elements for the representation.
