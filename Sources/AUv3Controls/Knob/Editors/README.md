# Editors

Some experiments on how to show a value editor for a knob. The original -- [EditorFeature](EditorFeature.swift) -- shows
a small entry in place of the knob with some fun animations going between the two. However, it does not work very well
when the keyboard appears on an real device. The [ValueEditorPrompt](ValueEditorPrompt.swift) modifier works much better
on real devices.
